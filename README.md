## 1. Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>
With improved instrumentation and sample preparation protocols, a large number of high-quality 
cryo-ET images are rapidly being generated in laboratories, opening the possibility to conduct 
high-throughput studies in cryo-ET. However, due to the crowded nature of the cellular environment 
together with image acquisition limitations, data mining and image analysis of cryo-ET tomograms 
remains one of the most important bottlenecks in the field.
We present DeePiCt (Deep Picker in Context), a deep-learning based pipeline to achieve structure 
segmentation and particle localization in cryo-electron tomography. DeePiCt combines two dedicated 
convolutional networks: a 2D CNN for segmentation of cellular compartments (e.g. organelles or cytosol),
and a 3D CNN for particle localization and structure segmentation.

## 2. Installation<a name="Installation"></a>

Both 2D and 3D CNN pipelines require a conda installation, and are run via the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Requirements and conda environment

Package Installation (miniconda, Pytorch and Keras).

#### Miniconda

Download the latest miniconda3 release, according to your OS and processor (modify the Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
file according to the instructions available [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)):

```bash
cd foldertodownload
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

during installation, you'll be asked where to install miniconda. Select a folder with large capacity:

```bash
/path/to/folder/with/large/capacity/miniconda3
```

### Virtual environment

#### Create a basic conda environment with Snakemake and pandas
The necessary virtual environment for the installation needs only snakemake and pandas

```bash
conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
conda activate base
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake==5.13.0 python=3.7
conda activate snakemake
conda install pandas
```


Install Pytorch (for 2d?):

```bash
conda install -c pytorch pytorch-cuda torchvision
```

Install Keras (for 3d?):

```
conda install -c anaconda keras-gpu=2.3.1
```

### Clone this repository

```bash
cd /folder/where/the/repository/will/be/cloned
git clone https://github.com/ZauggGroup/DeePiCt.git
```

## 3. How to run<a name="How_to_run"></a>

Go to the folder where you plan to run the experiments. Create a
configuration file -with the structure given in the examples (see each of the 
2d_cnn/config.yaml or 3d_cnn/config.yaml files)-. Run the pipeline by:

- 2D CNN pipeline:
```bash /path/to/2d_cnn/deploy_cluster.sh  /path/to/config.yaml```

- 3D CNN pipeline:
```bash /path/to/3d_cnn/deploy_cluster.sh  /path/to/config.yaml```

(notice that, to run locally the deploy_cluster.sh script can be exchanged by deploy_local.sh).

### Configuration <a name="Configuration"></a>
We refer to the [2d_cnn/README.md](2d_cnn/README.md) and [3d_cnn/README.md](3d_cnn/README.md) files for corresponding specifications.

## 4. Colab Notebooks <a name="Colab"></a>

We provide two notebooks to try out the prediction of 2D and 3D CNN trained models on one tomogram. The the spectrum matching filter is not included in the notebooks. This step should be done beforehand, following the instructions [here](spectrum_filter/README.md). 

To predict cytosol or organelles, you can use the 2D trained models: 

### `DeePiCt_predict2d.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ZauggGroup/DeePiCt/blob/main/DeePiCt_predict2d.ipynb).

To predict ribosome, membrane, microtubules or FAS, you can use the 3D trained models:

### `DeePiCt_predict3d.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ZauggGroup/DeePiCt/blob/main/DeePiCt_predict3d.ipynb).

## 5. Trained Models <a name="Models"></a>
Trained models are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oavbtcvusi07xbh/AADmnwIIsLUH1DuJ03IdDO7Ta?dl=0). 
All models were trained with cryo-ET data (4-times binned, unbinned pixel size 3.37 A) pre-processed using the spectrum matching filter with spectrum_TS_001.tsv.  

## 6. Additional Scripts <a name="useful_scripts"></a>

A number of useful scripts can be found in the folder [`additional_scripts/`](additional_scripts/).
`python additional_scripts/<script_name> --help` to learn how to use it.

Below the list.

- `motl2sph_mask.py`

Script that converts coordinate lists into spherical masks, to produce training data for the
3D CNN. Example:
```
python DeePiCt/additional_scripts/motl2sph_mask.py -r 8 -motl test_motl.csv -o \
Downloads/test_mask.mrc -shape 900 900 500 -value 1
```

- `elliptical_distance_constraint.py`

Script to merge several lists of coordinates into a single one, avoiding duplicates and imposing
elliptical distance constrains to respect (possibly different) minimal distance between points 
along axis x, y, z. The elliptic coefficients a b and c represent the corresponding 
minimum distance in voxels. Example:
```
python DeePiCt/additional_scripts/elliptical_distance_constraint.py --abc 9 9 15 -f test_motl1.csv test_motl2.csv \
-o merged_list.csv 
```
